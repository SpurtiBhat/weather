# Weather Display Web Application

This project is a user-friendly Weather Display Web Application designed to provide real-time weather updates for any city. Users can enter the name of their city to instantly retrieve comprehensive weather details, including temperature, sky conditions (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy), and wind speed.

The application utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data. By dynamically updating the displayed information based on user input, it ensures a smooth and interactive user experience.

The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a clean interface and seamless functionality. The JavaScript code handles API requests and processes the data to display weather information dynamically, eliminating the need for manual refreshes.

This web application serves as a simple yet practical tool for users to stay informed about the weather in their location or any other city worldwide. It can be further extended with features like a 5-day forecast, sunrise/sunset times, or a graphical representation of weather trends
