Weather Display Web Application

This contains the structure for a simple weather display web application. Users can input their city name to retrieve weather information, including temperature, sky conditions, and wind speed. The JavaScript code fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API, dynamically updating the displayed information based on user input.
